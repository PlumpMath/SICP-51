It looks like the tallest the recursive tree can get is equal to the amount. So the growth of space grows linearly with the amount.

The growth of the number of steps used by the process is determined by kinds-of-coins. If you look at the branch of the tree where kinds-of-coins == 1, the number of steps grows linearly with the amount. For each additional increase in kinds of coins, the tree doubles.

kinds-of-coins = 1, O(amount)
kinds-of-coins = 2, O(amount^2)
kinds-of-coins = 3, O(amount^3)
...
