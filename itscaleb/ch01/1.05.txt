calling the procedure (p) will cause an infinate loop.

Because applicative order evaluation evaluates the arguments first and then applies,

`(test 0 (p))` will never terminate since it will evaluate `(p)` when the procedure
is called.

Normal order evaluation will finish the evaluation of `(test 0 (p))` with the result 
of 0, because the execution path will not read the evaluation of `(p)`.
