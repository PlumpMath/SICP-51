a.) The procedure is applied 5 times because sine gets recusively called 5 times, and the result of that is a chain of deferred evaluations of p.

b.) The space used by the sine procedure is in the form of the deferred recursive procedure calls. The growth in dependent ond the input 'angle', which gets devided by 3 on each recursive call. So 'angle' can increase 3x for each recursive call.  So the order of growth of space is O(log n).
With the same reasoning above, the growth of the number of steps is also O(log n). Another constant set of steps is needed when 'angle' is increased 3x.
