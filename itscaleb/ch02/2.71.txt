This is what the tree looks like for N = 5:

    	  	       		  '(ABCDE) 31
				   /     \
			    '(ABCD) 15    (E 16)
			    /      \
 			'(ABC) 7   (D 8)
			/    \
		   '(AB) 3    (C 4)
		   /    \
		(A 1)  (B 2)

The depth of the tree is n-1, which is how many bits are required for the
symbols at the bottom of the tree (the least frequent symbols).

The most frequently used symbol at the top of the tree only requires 1 bit.
