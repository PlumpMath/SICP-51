Louis Reasoner tries to evaluate the expression
`(magnitude z)' where `z' is the object shown in *Note Figure
2-24::.  To his surprise, instead of the answer 5 he gets an error
message from `apply-generic', saying there is no method for the
operation `magnitude' on the types `(complex)'.  He shows this
interaction to Alyssa P. Hacker, who says "The problem is that the
complex-number selectors were never defined for `complex' numbers,
just for `polar' and `rectangular' numbers.  All you have to do to
make this work is add the following to the `complex' package:"

(put 'real-part '(complex) real-part)
(put 'imag-part '(complex) imag-part)
(put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude)
(put 'angle '(complex) angle)

Describe in detail why this works.  As an example, trace through
all the procedures called in evaluating the expression `(magnitude
z)' where `z' is the object shown in *Note Figure 2-24::.  In
particular, how many times is `apply-generic' invoked?  What
procedure is dispatched to in each case?

---

The reason that this works is because 'apply-generics' will look at
the tag of 'z', determine that it is '(complex), and will lookup the
procedure 'magnitude' in the table. It will then apply 'magnitude'
to (contents z), which strips out the outer tag, '(complex).

'apply-generics will be invoked once again, but this time the tag of
the argument will be 'rectangular. It will then look up the procudure 
to call based on the tag 'rectangular and the operation 'magnitude'
to find the correct procdure to call.
